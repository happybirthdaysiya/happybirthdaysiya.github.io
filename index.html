                <h2>Hey siya</h2>
                <p>
                    Could you BE any more awesome? Today, we celebrate the amazing person you are and all the joy you bring into our lives, just like our favorite gang at Central Perk. May your day be filled with as much fun and laughter as a day with Joey's antics, Chandler's jokes, and Phoebe's quirky songs.
                    Like Ross and Rachel, I hope your year is full of exciting moments and surprises. And just like Monica, may your day be perfectly organized and filled with love and warmth from friends and family. I know that you're our Lobster, and today is all about you! So, grab a coffee, relax on the couch, and let the celebrations begin! Here's to a year as unforgettable as one of Phoebe's melodies, and as comforting as Monica's kitchen.
                    Happy Birthday! Iâ€™ll be there for you, today and always!
                </p>
